# Pet Portal (Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind)

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open the site at the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Notes
- This is a demo UI ported from a single `.tsx` file into a small multi-page app using React Router and simple context.
- The demo uses external images from unsplash; an internet connection is required to load them.
- For any issues, share the terminal output and I'll help debug.
